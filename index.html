    “Turing Tests” is a collection of data science challenges suitable for
    testing out new algorithms, ideas, and opinions. It is primarily intended
    for the use of researchers at
    <a href="https://turing.ac.uk"> the Alan Turing Institute</a> but everyone
    is welcome to make use of it.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are hoping to create a set of challenges which include all the day-to-day
    problems that beset the typical data scientist as well as more sophisticated
    tasks. To that end, we welcome submissions. At the moment submissions must
    include data that can be shared without restrictions. That may change.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is not intended that the resources posted here must necessarily be
    new. Many are republications of existing datasets.
  </p>
  <p>
    This service is currently in beta.
